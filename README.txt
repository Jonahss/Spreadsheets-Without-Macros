Welcome!

I recently had the thought that Spreadsheets might be Turing complete,
and am assembling some examples of what can be done with Spreadsheets alone.

These examples demonstrate what can be done, and can hopefully serve as a
learning tool for those who wish to learn in a visual setting about the way
our computers work.

OpenOffice.org Calc does not support iterative spreadsheets (which allow circular
references) the same way that Microsoft Excel does, so I am forced to use one
simple macro which increments one cell continuously.

It's turing machines simulated using a reactive programming paradigm!
